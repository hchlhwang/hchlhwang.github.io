  #  followup: | 
  #     inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like $$ E = mc^2 $$.

# To use display mode, again surround your expression with `$$` and place it as a separate paragraph. Here is an example:

# $$
# \sum_{k=1}^\infty |\langle x, e_k \rangle|^2 \leq \|x\|^2
# $$

# You can also use `\begin{equation}...\end{equation}` instead of `$$` for display mode math.
# MathJax will automatically number equations:

# \begin{equation}
# \label{eq:cauchy-schwarz}
# \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
# \end{equation}
