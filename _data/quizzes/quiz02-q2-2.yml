   question: <b>2-2. <a style='color:#B509AC;'>Newtonian Dynamics - Rotational Motion.</a></b> Letâ€™s assume that $50N$ force is applied to the flywheel with radius $r=1m$. Given that the rotational inertia of the flywheel is $0.5kg\,m^2$, what is the angular acceleration ($\alpha$) of the flywheel? Hint try to get the torque ($\tau$) first and then obtain the angular acceleration by using the equation $\tau = \text{I}\alpha$.
