 - type: "multiple-choice"
   question: <a style='color:#B509AC;'>Grubler's law.</a> Select all correct statements of the following equation? $$m (N-1) - \sum_{i=1}^J (m - f_i).$$
   items:
    - choice: $J$ is the number of links
      correct: false
    - choice: $m$ is the dimension of the configuration space
      correct: true
    - choice: $N$ is the number of links excluding the ground link
      correct: false
    - choice: $f_i$ replies to the joint constraints
      correct: true
  #  followup: | 
  #     inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like $$ E = mc^2 $$.

# To use display mode, again surround your expression with `$$` and place it as a separate paragraph. Here is an example:

# $$
# \sum_{k=1}^\infty |\langle x, e_k \rangle|^2 \leq \|x\|^2
# $$

# You can also use `\begin{equation}...\end{equation}` instead of `$$` for display mode math.
# MathJax will automatically number equations:

# \begin{equation}
# \label{eq:cauchy-schwarz}
# \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
# \end{equation}
