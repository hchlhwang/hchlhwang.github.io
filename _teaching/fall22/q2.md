<b><a style='color:#2698BA;'>Explanation.</a></b>  The Jacobian matrix maps joint velocity ($\dot{q}$) to cartesian velocity (velocity of the end effector; $\dot{x}$): $\dot{x} = J\dot{q}$. We can derive this by differentiating the forward kinematics equation: $x(t) = f(q(t))$. By using the chain rule, the time derivative can be expressed as: 

<p>$ \dot{x} = \frac{\partial f(q)}{\partial q}\frac{d q(t)}{dt} = \frac{\partial f(q)}{\dot{q}} = J(q)\dot{q}$.</p>

<p>Generalized force can be computed using the Jacobian transpose given external force $F$: $\tau = J^{\top}F$. We can use the conservation of energy to derive this relationship. Work is the application of force over a distance: $W=\int F^{\top}v dt$. Note that $W$ is denoted for work, $F$ is force, and $v$ is velocity. Since power is the rate at which work is performed, we can get the following expression ($\tau$ represents the force in joint-space (torque if the system consists of revolute joints) that affects the movement of the end-effector):</p> <br>

<p>$P = \frac{W}{t} = \frac{F^{\top}d}{t}=F^{\top}\frac{d}{t}=F^{\top}v$. </p> <br>

<p>Therefore, we can express this in terms of Cartesian space (end-effector space) and joint-space:</p> <br>

<p>$P=F^{\top}\dot{x}$,</p>
<p>$P=\tau^{\top}\dot{q}$.</p> <br>
<p>And these are equivalent, meaning that work is performed at the same rate regardless of the system.</p> <br>
<p>$\tau^{\top}\dot{q}=F^{\top}\dot{x}$.</p> <br>
<p>We can derive the final equation using the velocity mapping equation: $\dot{x} = J\dot{q}$.</p> <br>
<p>$\tau^{\top}\dot{q}=F^{\top}J\dot{q}$,</p> <br>
<p>$\tau^{\top}=F^{\top}J$,</p> <br>
<p>$\tau=J^{\top}F$.</p> <br>
<p>Note that $J  \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ where $n$ comes from the set of joint variables ($q \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$) and $m$ comes from the minimal set of coordinates where the end-effector configuration can be represented ($x \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$).</p><br><br><br><br>

<b><a style='color:#2698BA;'>Explanation.</a></b> Centripetal force is the component of force acting on an object in curvilinear motion which is directed towards the axis of rotation or center of curvature. Centrifugal force is a pseudo (virtual) force in circular motion which acts along the radius and is directed away from the center of the circle. The magnitude of the two forces are identical.</p>

<b><a style='color:#2698BA;'>Explanation.</a></b> By inserting values in $\tau =  F r$, we obtain $\tau = 50 Nm$. We can get the angular acceleration by inserting values in $\tau = \text{I}\alpha$. We obtain $\alpha = \frac{\tau}{\text{I}} = \frac{50 Nm}{0.5 kg\,m^2} = 100rad/s^2$. Note that $1N = 1kg\,m/s^2$.</p>
