  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={A robot guide dog has compelling advantages over animal guide dogs for its cost-effectiveness, potential for mass production, and low maintenance burden. However, despite the long history of guide dog robot research, previous studies were conducted with little or no consideration of how the guide dog handler and the guide dog work as a team for navigation. To develop a robotic guiding system that is genuinely beneficial to blind or visually impaired individuals, we performed qualitative research, including interviews with guide dog handlers and trainers and first-hand blindfold walking experiences with various guide dogs. Grounded on the facts learned from vivid experience and interviews, we build a collaborative indoor navigation scheme for a guide dog robot that includes preferred features such as speed and directional control. For collaborative navigation, we propose a semantic- aware local path planner that enables safe and efficient guiding work by utilizing semantic information about the environment and considering the handler’s position and directional cues to determine the collision-free path. We evaluate our integrated robotic system by testing guide blindfold walking in indoor settings and demonstrate guide dog-like navigation behavior by avoiding obstacles at typical gait speed (0.7 m/s).},

  abstract={Past research aimed at increasing the sensitivity of capacitive pressure sensors has mostly focused on developing dielectric layers with surface/porous structures or higher dielectric constants. However, such strategies have only been effective in improving sensitivities at low pressure ranges (e.g., up to 3 kPa). To overcome this well-known obstacle, herein, a flexible hybrid-response pressure sensor (HRPS) composed of an electrically conductive porous nanocomposite (PNC) laminated with an ultrathin dielectric layer is devised. Using a nickel foam template, the PNC is fabricated with carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-doped Ecoflex to be 86% porous and electrically conductive. The PNC exhibits hybrid piezoresistive and piezocapacitive responses, resulting in significantly enhanced sensitivities (i.e., more than 400%) over wide pressure ranges, from 3.13 kPa−1 within 0–1 kPa to 0.43 kPa−1 within 30–50 kPa. The effect of the hybrid responses is differentiated from the effect of porosity or high dielectric constants by comparing the HRPS with its purely piezocapacitive counterparts. Fundamental understanding of the HRPS and the prediction of optimal CNT doping are achieved through simplified analytical models. The HRPS is able to measure pressures from as subtle as the temporal arterial pulse to as large as footsteps.},

  abstract={To train deep learning models for vision-based action recognition of elders’ daily activities, we need large-scale activity datasets acquired under various daily living environments and conditions. However, most public datasets used in human action recognition either differ from or have limited coverage of elders’ activities in many aspects, making it challenging to recognize elders’ daily activities well by only utilizing existing datasets. Recently, such limitations of available datasets have actively been compensated by generating synthetic data from realistic simulation environments and using those data to train deep learning models. In this paper, based on these ideas we develop ElderSim, an action simulation platform that can generate synthetic data on elders’ daily activities. For 55 kinds of frequent daily activities of the elders, ElderSim generates realistic motions of synthetic characters with various adjustable data-generating options and provides different output modalities including RGB videos, two- and three-dimensional skeleton trajectories. We then generate KIST SynADL, a large-scale synthetic dataset of elders’ activities of daily living, from ElderSim and use the data in addition to real datasets to train three state-of-the-art human action recognition models. From the experiments following several newly proposed scenarios that assume different real and synthetic dataset configurations for training, we observe a noticeable performance improvement by augmenting our synthetic data. We also offer guidance with insights for the effective utilization of synthetic data to help recognize elders’ daily activities.},

  abstract={In this paper, we devise methods for the multiobjective control of humanoid robots, a.k.a. prioritized whole-body controllers, that achieve efficiency and robustness in the algorithmic computations. We use a form of whole-body controllers that is very general via incorporating centroidal momentum dynamics, operational task priorities, contact reaction forces, and internal force constraints. First, we achieve efficiency by solving a quadratic program that only involves the floating base dynamics and the reaction forces. Second, we achieve computational robustness by relaxing task accelerations such that they comply with friction cone constraints. Finally, we incorporate methods for smooth contact transitions to enhance the control of dynamic locomotion behaviors. The proposed methods are demonstrated both in simulation and in real experiments using a passive-ankle bipedal robot.},

  abstract={We propose a methodology for dynamically balancing passive-ankled bipeds and full humanoids. As dynamic locomotion without ankle-actuation is more difficult than with actuated feet, our control scheme adopts an efficient whole-body controller that combines inverse kinematics, contact-consistent feed-forward torques, and low-level motor position controllers. To understand real-world sensing and controller requirements, we perform an uncertainty analysis on the linear-inverted-pendulum (LIP)-based footstep planner. This enables us to identify necessary hardware and control refinements to demonstrate that our controller can achieve long-term unsupported dynamic balancing on our series-elastic biped, Mercury. Through simulations, we also demonstrate that our control scheme for dynamic balancing with passive-ankles is applicable to full humanoid robots.},
