  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={While guide dogs offer essential mobility assistance, their high cost, limited availability, and care requirements make them inaccessible to most blind or low vision (BLV) individuals. Recent advances in quadruped robots provide a scalable solution for mobility assistance, but many current designs fail to meet real-world needs due to a lack of understanding of handler and guide dog interactions. In this paper, we share lessons learned from developing a human-centered guide dog robot, addressing challenges such as optimal hardware design, robust navigation, and informative scene description for user adoption. By conducting semi-structured interviews and hu- man experiments with BLV individuals, guide-dog handlers, and trainers, we identified key design principles to improve safety, trust, and usability in robotic mobility aids. Our findings lay the building blocks for future development of guide dog robots, ultimately enhancing independence and quality of life for BLV individuals.},

  abstract={Robotic mobility aids for blind and low-vision (BLV) individuals rely heavily on deep learning-based vision models specialized for various navigational tasks. However, the performance of these models is often constrained by the availability and diversity of real-world datasets, which are challenging to collect in sufficient quantities for different tasks. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of synthetic data, generated using Unreal Engine 4, for training robust vision models for this safety-critical application. Our findings demonstrate that synthetic data can enhance model performance across multiple tasks, showcasing both its potential and its limitations when compared to real-world data. We offer valuable insights into optimizing synthetic data generation for developing robotic mobility aids. Additionally, we publicly release our generated synthetic dataset to support ongoing research in assistive technologies for BLV individuals, available at https://hchlhwang.github.io/SToP.},

  abstract={Safely navigating street intersections is a complex challenge for blind and low-vision individuals, as it requires a nuanced understanding of the surrounding context -- a task heavily reliant on visual cues. Traditional methods for assisting in this decision-making process often fall short, lacking the ability to provide a comprehensive scene analysis and safety level. This paper introduces an innovative approach that leverages large multimodal models (LMMs) to interpret complex street crossing scenes, offering a potential advancement over conventional traffic signal recognition techniques. By generating a safety score and scene description in natural language, our method supports safe decision-making for the blind and low-vision individuals. We collected crosswalk intersection data that contains multiview egocentric images captured by a quadruped robot and annotated the images with corresponding safety scores based on our predefined safety score categorization. Grounded on the visual knowledge, extracted from images, and  text prompt, we evaluate a large multimodal model for safety score prediction and scene description. Our findings highlight the reasoning and safety score prediction capabilities of a LMM, activated by various prompts, as a pathway to developing a trustworthy system, crucial for applications requiring reliable decision-making support.},

  abstract={Dog guides are favored by blind and low-vision (BLV) individuals for their ability to enhance independence and confidence by reducing safety concerns and increasing navigation efficiency compared to traditional mobility aids. However, only a relatively small proportion of BLV people work with dog guides due to their limited availability and associated maintenance responsibilities. There is considerable recent interest in addressing this challenge by developing legged guide dog robots. This study was designed to determine critical aspects of the handler-guide dog interaction and better understand handler needs to inform guide dog robot development. We conducted semi-structured interviews and observation sessions with 23 dog guide handlers and 5 trainers. Thematic analysis revealed critical limitations in guide dog work, desired personalization in handler-guide dog interaction, and important perspectives on future guide dog robots. Grounded on these findings, we discuss pivotal design insights for guide dog robots aimed for adoption within the BLV community.},

  abstract={A robot guide dog has compelling advantages over animal guide dogs for its cost-effectiveness, potential for mass production, and low maintenance burden. However, despite the long history of guide dog robot research, previous studies were conducted with little or no consideration of how the guide dog handler and the guide dog work as a team for navigation. To develop a robotic guiding system that is genuinely beneficial to blind or visually impaired individuals, we performed qualitative research, including interviews with guide dog handlers and trainers and first-hand blindfold walking experiences with various guide dogs. Grounded on the facts learned from vivid experience and interviews, we build a collaborative indoor navigation scheme for a guide dog robot that includes preferred features such as speed and directional control. For collaborative navigation, we propose a semantic- aware local path planner that enables safe and efficient guiding work by utilizing semantic information about the environment and considering the handler‚Äôs position and directional cues to determine the collision-free path. We evaluate our integrated robotic system by testing guide blindfold walking in indoor settings and demonstrate guide dog-like navigation behavior by avoiding obstacles at typical gait speed (0.7 m/s).},

  abstract={As robots increase in agility and encounter fast- moving objects, dynamic object detection and avoidance become notably challenging. Traditional RGB cameras, burdened by motion blur and high latency, often act as the bottleneck. Event cameras have recently emerged as a promising solution for the challenges related to rapid movement. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic object avoidance framework that integrates both event and RGBD cameras. Specifically, this framework first estimates and compensates for the event‚Äôs motion to detect dynamic objects. Subsequently, depth data is combined to derive a 3D trajectory. When initiating from a static state, the robot adjusts its height based on the predicted collision point to avoid the dynamic obstacle. Through real-world experiments with the Mini-Cheetah, our approach successfully circumvents dynamic objects at speeds up to 5 m/s, achieving an 83% success rate.

  abstract={Past research aimed at increasing the sensitivity of capacitive pressure sensors has mostly focused on developing dielectric layers with surface/porous structures or higher dielectric constants. However, such strategies have only been effective in improving sensitivities at low pressure ranges (e.g., up to 3 kPa). To overcome this well-known obstacle, herein, a flexible hybrid-response pressure sensor (HRPS) composed of an electrically conductive porous nanocomposite (PNC) laminated with an ultrathin dielectric layer is devised. Using a nickel foam template, the PNC is fabricated with carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-doped Ecoflex to be 86% porous and electrically conductive. The PNC exhibits hybrid piezoresistive and piezocapacitive responses, resulting in significantly enhanced sensitivities (i.e., more than 400%) over wide pressure ranges, from 3.13 kPa‚àí1 within 0‚Äì1 kPa to 0.43 kPa‚àí1 within 30‚Äì50 kPa. The effect of the hybrid responses is differentiated from the effect of porosity or high dielectric constants by comparing the HRPS with its purely piezocapacitive counterparts. Fundamental understanding of the HRPS and the prediction of optimal CNT doping are achieved through simplified analytical models. The HRPS is able to measure pressures from as subtle as the temporal arterial pulse to as large as footsteps.},

  abstract={To train deep learning models for vision-based action recognition of elders‚Äô daily activities, we need large-scale activity datasets acquired under various daily living environments and conditions. However, most public datasets used in human action recognition either differ from or have limited coverage of elders‚Äô activities in many aspects, making it challenging to recognize elders‚Äô daily activities well by only utilizing existing datasets. Recently, such limitations of available datasets have actively been compensated by generating synthetic data from realistic simulation environments and using those data to train deep learning models. In this paper, based on these ideas we develop ElderSim, an action simulation platform that can generate synthetic data on elders‚Äô daily activities. For 55 kinds of frequent daily activities of the elders, ElderSim generates realistic motions of synthetic characters with various adjustable data-generating options and provides different output modalities including RGB videos, two- and three-dimensional skeleton trajectories. We then generate KIST SynADL, a large-scale synthetic dataset of elders‚Äô activities of daily living, from ElderSim and use the data in addition to real datasets to train three state-of-the-art human action recognition models. From the experiments following several newly proposed scenarios that assume different real and synthetic dataset configurations for training, we observe a noticeable performance improvement by augmenting our synthetic data. We also offer guidance with insights for the effective utilization of synthetic data to help recognize elders‚Äô daily activities.},

  abstract={In this paper, we devise methods for the multiobjective control of humanoid robots, a.k.a. prioritized whole-body controllers, that achieve efficiency and robustness in the algorithmic computations. We use a form of whole-body controllers that is very general via incorporating centroidal momentum dynamics, operational task priorities, contact reaction forces, and internal force constraints. First, we achieve efficiency by solving a quadratic program that only involves the floating base dynamics and the reaction forces. Second, we achieve computational robustness by relaxing task accelerations such that they comply with friction cone constraints. Finally, we incorporate methods for smooth contact transitions to enhance the control of dynamic locomotion behaviors. The proposed methods are demonstrated both in simulation and in real experiments using a passive-ankle bipedal robot.},

As dynamic locomotion without ankle-actuation is more difficult than with actuated feet, our control scheme adopts an efficient whole-body controller that combines inverse kinematics, contact-consistent feed-forward torques, and low-level motor position controllers. To understand real-world sensing and controller requirements, we perform an uncertainty analysis on the linear-inverted-pendulum (LIP)-based footstep planner. This enables us to identify necessary hardware and control refinements to demonstrate that our controller can achieve long-term unsupported dynamic balancing on our series-elastic biped, Mercury. Through simulations, we also demonstrate that our control scheme for dynamic balancing with passive-ankles is applicable to full humanoid robots.},
