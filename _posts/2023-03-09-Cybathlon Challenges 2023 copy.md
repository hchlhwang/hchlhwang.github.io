## Cybathlon Challenges 2023

[CYBATHLON](https://cybathlon.ethz.ch/en), a project of ETH Zurich, acts as a platform that challenges teams from all over the world to develop assistive technologies suitable for everyday use with and for people with disabilities. The driving force behind CYBATHLON is international competitions and events, in which teams consisting of technology developers from universities, companies or NGOs and a person with disabilities (pilot) tackle various everyday tasks with their latest assistive technologies.

CYBATHLON is held every four years since 2016. It will be held next year, 2024. This year they are organizing the CYBATHLON Challeneges having two tasks for each discipline. 

***

## Vision Assistive Race 

It is the first year for CYBATHLON to have a race considering the blind or visually impaired individuals.

## Tasks

Task 1: Sidewalk. The aim is to reach the end line without bumping into any obstacles.

Task 2: Serving food. The aim is to 1) pour water to a designated level, 2) carry & balance a tray having a bowl and glass filled with water, 3) placing the bowl and glass without touching the utensils that are already set on the table.

## Team

Thankfully, the recruitment process was relatively smooth. We have two incredible pilots (with great atheletic abilities) and one guide dog trainer. We also have great faculty members joining. Finally, we have wonderful members for developing hardware, software, and conducting experiments. Always thankful for everyone. Especially, thankful for my advisor for the support. 

Our team name is [FlashLight](https://cybathlon.ethz.ch/en/teams/flash-light). We aim to light up the path for the blind or visually impaired individuals to quickly accomplish tasks.
