## Vision Assistive Race Results

Our FlashLight team was placed in 2nd place for the Vision Assistive Race. Although we were close to completing the first task, unfortunately, we were not able finish a single task as shown below. The light reflection issue was a challenge for task 1 and our implementation for solving task 2 was not fully integrated.

## Takeaways

Solving a problem for a competition is different from solving a real-world problem. In a competition, we could use heuristical methods and rely on the ability of the pilot to solve problems. However, such method would be limited when deployed in real-world scenarios. 

Simple is best. Our system was complex compared to a single mobuile device as our system contained various sensors and motors to provide feedback to the pilot. The hardware and software of our system was not optimized at the time of the competition. 

Our pilots mentioned that the second task was not relevant to the real-world as they usually did not serve food.

## CYBATHLON 2024

It was meaningful to join the CYBATHLON Challneges 2023 Vison Assistance Race (VIS). It was the first time to have the VIS race. I can know see that there are multiple groups joining the CYBATHLON 2024. I believe that CYBATHLON can push the advancements in assistive technologies aiming for real-world deployment.
