## Assistive Robotics for the Visually Impaired

**[Vision-Only Long-Range Route Following](https://guidedogrobot-navigation.github.io)** — Enabling guide dog robots to follow long-range routes using only visual inputs.

**[Handler-Guide Dog Interaction Dataset](https://guidedogrobot-hgidataset.github.io)** — A dataset capturing interactions between handlers and guide dogs for robot learning.

**[Quiet and Stable Locomotion Control](https://guidedogrobot-stairclimbing.github.io)** — Developing stable and quiet locomotion for quadruped robots during stair climbing.

**[Semantic-Aware Indoor Obstacle Avoidance](https://guidedogrobot-obstacleavoid.github.io)** — Indoor obstacle avoidance using semantic scene understanding.

**[The Synthetic Tactile-on-Paving (SToP) Dataset](/SToP/)** — A synthetic dataset for tactile paving detection to aid visually impaired pedestrians.

## Competitions

**[CYBATHLON Challenges 2023](/Cybathlon/)** — Vision Assistance Race for blind and visually impaired individuals (2nd Place).

## Other Research
