## Assistive Robotics for the Blind & Low-Vision People

**[GuideNav: Vision-Only Long-Range Route Following](https://guidedogrobot-navigation.github.io)** — Robust visual teach-and-repeat for kilometer-scale route following using only images.

**[GuideData: Handler-Guide Dog Interaction Dataset](https://guidedogrobot-hgidataset.github.io)** — A dataset capturing interactions between handlers and guide dogs for guide dog robot design implications.

**[GuideTWSI: Stopping at Tactile Pavings](https://guidedogrobot-tactile.github.io/)** — Synthetic TWSI data generation for tactile paving segmentation and stopping.

**[Quiet and Stable Locomotion Control](https://guidedogrobot-stairclimbing.github.io)** — Stable and low-noise locomotion controller for quiet walking and smooth stair climbing.

**[System Integration & Obstacle Avoidance](https://guidedogrobot-obstacleavoid.github.io)** — Guide dog robot configuration and semantics-aware local path planning.

**[The Synthetic Tactile-on-Paving (SToP) Dataset](/SToP/)** — Unreal Engine-based synthetic data augmentation for tactile paving detection.

## Competitions

**[CYBATHLON Vision Assistance Race 2023](/Cybathlon/)** — Solving real-world problems for blind and low-vision people.

## Other Research

**[Event Cameras for Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance](/AvoidEvent/)** — Highly dynamic obstacle detection using event cameras.

**[ElderSim](/Eldercare/)** — A synthetic data generation platform for human action recognition in eldercare applications.
