I received my B.S. in Robotics Engineering from Hanyang University ERICA, Republic of Korea, in 2019. 
I previously worked as a research intern at the Visual Intelligence Group at Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) from 2019 to 2020 with the support from Dr. [Ig-Jae Kim](https://sites.google.com/view/ijkim) and Dr. [Junghyun Cho](https://junghyuncho.notion.site/Junghyun-Cho-36f85eff362148dab9e23e6628fe3551). 
Before joining KIST, I participated research in Human Centered Robotics Laboratory lead by Prof. [Luis Sentis](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/sentis) at the University of Texas at Austin.
I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst advised by Prof. [Donghyun Kim](https://www.cics.umass.edu/people/kim-donghyun).
