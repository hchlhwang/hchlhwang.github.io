I am a Ph.D. candidate at UMass Amherst developing **guide dog robots** for visually impaired individuals. My research spans **robot perception**, **planning**, and **human-robot interaction**.

**Perception & Planning** — Building vision-based navigation systems using foundation models for safe, long-term autonomy.

**Human-Robot Interaction** — Investigating how users interact with assistive robots through field studies, informing design for real-world deployment.

Advised by [Donghyun Kim](https://www.cics.umass.edu/people/kim-donghyun), co-advised by [Ivan Lee](https://www.umass.edu/ials/people/sunghoon-ivan-lee) and [Joydeep Biswas](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/people/faculty-researchers/joydeep-biswas).
