I received my B.S. in Robotics Engineering from [Hanyang University at Ansan](http://www.hanyang.ac.kr/), Republic of Korea, in 2019. 
I previously worked a research intern at the [Artificial Intelligence & Robotics Institute (AIRI)](https://www.airi.kist.re.kr) at [Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST)](https://eng.kist.re.kr/) from 2019 to 2020. 
Before joining KIST, I participated research as a research assistant in [Human Centered Robotics Laboratory](https://sites.utexas.edu/hcrl/) lead by [Prof. Luis Sentis](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/sentis) at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/).
I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu) fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Donghyun Kim](https://www.cics.umass.edu/people/kim-donghyun).
